# Wiki Viewer

This is a wikipedia search tool. You can type what you want to search for in the input box given, or you can click on random to get directed to a random article in wikipedia.
This project uses Wikipedia API for the search results. I've written the code in Javascript with ReactJS and the styling is purely CSS.
